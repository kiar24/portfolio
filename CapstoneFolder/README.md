# Capstone Project

## Welcome to My Capstone! Here, I will discuss much of the code behind my project.

The title of my project is 'Assessing the Relationship Between Immunosuppressant Medications and COVID-19 Presence and Severity in an Autoimmune Hepatitis Cohort' 

The objective of my project is to address the following research questions:
In patients diagnosed with AIH, does the type of immunosuppressive therapy influence the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcomes among those infected?

My special thanks to my Capstone Committee: Jin Ge, Karla Lindquist, and John Kornak.
